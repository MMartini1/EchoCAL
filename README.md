# EchoCAL: A Wireless Echosounder Calibration System. ![EchoCAL Logo](./EchoCalLogo.png)

The EchoCAL Wireless Echosounder Calibration System was designed to give Ocean Acoustics researchers the ability to control motorized downriggers remotely during scientific echosounder calibrations. A typical downrigger station consists of a control box wired to a Canon downrigger which is mounted on the railing of the research vessel. A typical calibration on a research vessel requires at least three downrigger stations. (Two on one side of the vessel, and one on the other side.)

The reseacher can control these downriggers wirelessly from inside the vessel. (See the figure below for a system diagram.)

## EchoCAL Project Files:

The following folders contain the required documentation to build one EchoCAL system:

### DesignFiles:

This folder contains a parts list as well as wiring diagrams for all EchoCAL hardware. This folder has two subfolders, "CircuitCard" and "WiringDiagrams". The "CircuitCard" folder contains the design files to manufacture the EchoCAL custom printed circuitboard (PCB). The "WiringDiagram" folder contains CAD, DXF, and PDF drawings for building all of the hardware for EchoCAL.

### Documentation:

This folder has the latest documentation.

### EchoCAL_GUI_Source:

This folder contains all of the [Netbeans](https://netbeans.org) JAVA Project source code for the EchoCAL Graphical User Interface (GUI).

### Parallax_Firmware:

This folder contains the firmware for the [Parallax Propeller](https://www.parallax.com/catalog/microcontrollers/propeller) Microcontroller.

### WGFAST_Presentation:

This folder contains a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation of the EchoCAL System. This presentation was given at the Working Group on Fisheries Acoustics, Science, and Technology ([WGFAST](http://www.ices.dk/community/groups/Pages/WGFAST.aspx)) meeting in May 2014. 

### bin:

This folder contains the executable code for the EchoCAL Graphical User Interface (GUI). The JAVA executable code is stored as a ZIP archive that can be downloaded and extracted on a user's computer. The archive was created using Netbeans IDE 8.1 and JAVA JDK 1.8 (64bit).

The "bin" folder has two subfolders, "Win64" and "Linux64". Download the proper version depending on which operating system you will be using.
